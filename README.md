# WorkAdventure Map Starter Kit

This is a starter kit to help you build your own map for [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re).

To understand how to use this starter kit, follow the tutorial at [https://workadventu.re/map-building](https://workadventu.re/map-building).


## Development

0. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
2. Open browser at `localhost:8080` and follow instructions

To edit the map, [download and install Tiled](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled). The tileset is called [Pipoya](https://pipoya.itch.io/pipoya-rpg-tileset-32x32) and it's already included in the map file.

Note that changes made are visible only after refreshing the browser (command-r)!
